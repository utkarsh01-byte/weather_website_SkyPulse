          Sky Pulse is a simple, fast companion for checking live weather
          anywhere in the world. It focuses on clear visuals, showing
          temperature, humidity, wind, and a matching sky icon in one
          easy‑to‑read card. <br></br>The goal is to give you just the
          information you actually need for daily plans, with a clean, modern
          design that can grow later with extras like forecasts or air‑quality
          details.
