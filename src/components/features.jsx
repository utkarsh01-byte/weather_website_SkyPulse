          This website provides a modern, global weather dashboard that shows
          real‑time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and matching weather
          icons in a clean card layout. Users can search any city and see
          instantly updated results without reloading, all on a dark, responsive
          interface with a semi‑transparent card that keeps information easy to
          read while displaying background visuals.
